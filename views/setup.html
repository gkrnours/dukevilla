        <h4>Anonymity... is like a warm blanket.</h4>
        <p>Duke's Villa is all about ranking people. But maybe you don't
        want to be ranked. That's fine. Just opt out. We'll still do our 
        best to keep track of your data. But you'll not appear on ranking 
        anymore, until you change your mind.</p>

        <h4>The more, the merrier.</h4>
        <p>Do you think it would be better if all your friend were present
        at the Duke's Villa with you ? Just ask. This option will update
        all your twinoid contact data. They'll not appear in ranking until
        they come by themselves. We'll just make sure they have all their
        data when they join.</p>

        <h4>Always on call.</h4>
        <p>Duke's Villa can keep track of your progress even when you
        forget to visit us. You're just one opt-in away from having a full
        history of all your future distinction gains.</p>
